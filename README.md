# w4mcorcov_galaxy_wrapper

Planemo-based galaxy-tool-wrapper to wrap a SIMCA® OPLS-DA® S-PLOT® "work-alike" tool.
This tool plots the correlation of each feature with the OPLS-DA projection of multivariate data for two classes of data against the covariance of the same.

The original plot which this tool emulates is described in:
